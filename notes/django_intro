So, What is Going On?
When you have installed Django and created your first Django web application, and the browser requests the URL, this is basically what happens:

Django receives the URL, checks the **urls.py** file, and calls the view that matches the URL.
The view, located in **views.py**, checks for relevant models.
The models are imported from the **models.py** file.
The view then sends the data to a specified template in the **template** folder.
The template contains HTML and Django tags, and with the data it returns finished HTML content back to the browser.
Django can do a lot more than this, but this is basically what you will learn in this tutorial, and are the basic steps in a simple web application made with Django.
